# Stresser
A free l7/l4 stresser for educational and testing purposes only!


# !! WARRNING !!
This is just for educational and testing purposes only!
NEVER USE IT ON SERVERS THAT ARE NOT YOURS!

Me (NaysKutzu) and (MythicalSystems) are not responsible for any damage.


# Why no proxy support?
Proxy makes it be slow and laggy asf thats why you have suppport for an api based attack so you can use it to attack with real machines and real power!


# Installtion
To install this just login inside your server and follow those commands 

```bash
cd /root
